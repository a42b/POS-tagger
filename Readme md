# Part-of-Speech Tagger with NLTK and TnT
I used NLTK as it seemed easirier for the first experoencd and it turned out exactly it. 
For training i used tnt. As a dataset I first used CLTT Treebank (36K) which gave the accuracy around 76%. But for my example sentences it showed most of the words as unknown. Then I tired training the model on CAC (495K), which went much better with accuracy around 86% and did decent for my sample sentences.
